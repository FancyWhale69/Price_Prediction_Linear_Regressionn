# Price_Prediction_Linear_Regressionn


# Project Motivation  
A new dealer ship has asked us to build a model to predict the prices of used luxury cars mainly Merc, BMW, and Audi and they want to automate the pricing process to achive three things:  
- Accuracy  
- Speed  
- Reduce cost

# File Descriptions  
Proposal- Folder containing the project's proposal  
MVP- Folder containing the project's Minimum vaiable product  
Code_Slides_writeup- Folder containing the project's notebook (in code folder), PowerPoint presentation (in slides folder), and a summery (in writeup folder)

# How To Interact With Your Project  
Open the notebook in jupyter notebook to view the code and technical details, or read the slides for a quick view about our findings, or visit the project's [DashBoard](https://used-luxury-cars.herokuapp.com/).


# Results Summery  
We found that there are 6 features which affect the price, which are:  
1- Year- The newer the car the more expensive it is.  
2- Cylinders- A great number of cylinders indicate that the car is ethier sporty or high end.  
3- Is the car electrical- Electric cars are more expensive then non-electric electric.  
4- MPG- Expensive cars have low mpg.(because they have bigger engines. see point 2).  
5- Mileage- The more mileage the car have the lower it price become.  
6- Gears- High end cars tend to have a great number of gears.
