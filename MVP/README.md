# Luxury used car price prediction.  
 Based on the analysis done, we came to conclude that these features are the most relevent in deciding the price:  
1. The newer the car the more expensive it is. 
2. A great number of cylinders indicate that the car is ethier sporty or high end.  
3. Electric cars are more expensive then non-electric electric.  
4. Expensive cars have low mpg.(because they have bigger engines. see point 2)
5. The more mileage the car have the lower it price become.
